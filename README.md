This program will ask the user for three different points in space, which includes all 3 dimensions of space.
Once the input is given the program will make a class called Point.
A function called computeArea finds the area of the triangle formed by the three input points.
In order to do this a distanceTo function is called that finds the distance between two points.

The area of the triangle is outputed to the user and then the program ends.
